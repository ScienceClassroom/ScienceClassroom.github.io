    <br>
    <h2 id="qa">Q&A</h2>
    <br>
    <p>What are the layers of the atmosphere?</p>
    <p>Exosphere, Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, and Thermosphere.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How is thermal energy transferred throughout the atmosphere?</p>
    <p>Conduction, convection, and radiation.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How do clouds form?</p>
    <p>Clouds form when rising air, through expansion, cools to the point where some of the water vapor molecules clump together.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What processes are involved in the water cycle?</p>
    <p>The most important are evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Why do differences in air pressure produce global winds?</p>
    <p>Because high air pressure areas are very close to low air pressure areas.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How do air masses interact along warm and cold fronts?</p>
    <p>The movements and collisions of fronts result in this.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What are the characteristics of severe storm systems?</p>
    <p>Precipitation and hail, to name two.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What factors determine climate?</p>
    <p>Elevation, altitude, wind patterns, topography, and geography.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What is a climate system?</p>
    <p>An interactive system consisting of five major components, the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the cyrosphere, the land surface, and the biosphere.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What are the dominant climate zones across the United States?</p>
    <p>Average high (Jan): 42; Average Low (Jan): 27</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How does climate change seasonally?</p>
    <p>The side of the earth facing the sun is experiencing summer, while the side facing away from the sun is experiencing winter.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What causes climate change?</p>
    <p>To name one, plate motion under the Earth's crust can affect climate over millions of years.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How do humans affect climate?</p>
    <p>We affect climate everytime we cut down trees and use gas-operated cars, to name a few.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What is El Nino’s effect on weather?</p>
    <p>Fewer fish can live in the Pacific Ocean during El Nino.</p>

    <h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Troposphere</p>
    <p>The lowest region of the atmosphere.</p>
    <img src="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/troposphere/en/tropo.en.png" />
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Temperature Inversion</p>
    <p>The action of inverting temperature.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Greenhouse Effect</p>
    <p>The trapping of the sun's warmth in a planet's lower atmosphere due to the greater transparency of the atmosphere to visible radiation from the sun than to infrared radiation emitted from the planet's surface.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Jet Stream</p>
    <p>A narrow, variable band of very strong, predominantly westerly air currents encircling the globe several miles above the earth.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Coriolis effect</p>
    <p>An effect whereby a mass moving in a rotating system experiences a force, the Coriolis force, acting perpendicular to the direction of motion and to the axis of rotation.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Air Mass</p>
    <p>A body of air with horizontally uniform temperature, humidity, and pressure.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Weather Front</p>
    <p>A weather front is a boundary separating two masses of air of different densities, and is the principal cause of meteorological phenomena outside the tropics.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Maritime Climate</p>
    <p>The Maritime climate is the Köppen classification of climate typical of west coasts in higher middle latitudes of continents, and generally features cool summers, relative to their latitude, and cool winters, with a relatively narrow annual temperature range and few extremes of temperature, with the exception for transitional areas to continental, subarctic and highland climates.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Continental Climate</p>
    <p>A relatively dry climate with very hot summers and very cold winters.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Sea Breeze</p>
    <p>A breeze blowing toward the land from the sea, especially during the day owing to the relative warmth of the land.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Global Warming</p>
    <p>A gradual increase in the overall temperature of the earth's atmosphere generally attributed to the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and other pollutants.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>El Nino</p>
    <p>An irregularly occurring and complex series of climatic changes affecting the equatorial Pacific region and beyond every few years, characterized by the appearance of unusually warm, nutrient-poor water off northern Peru and Ecuador, typically in late December.</p>
    <img src="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/gallery/mohippo/images/learning/learn-about-the-weather/el-nino.png" />
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>La Nina</p>
    <p>A cooling of the water in the equatorial Pacific that occurs at irregular intervals and is associated with widespread changes in weather patterns complementary to those of El Niño, but less extensive and damaging in their effects.</p>

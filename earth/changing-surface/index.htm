    <h2 id="qa">Q&A</h2>
    <br>
    <p>What is the role of weathering in recycling Earth materials?</p>
    <p>Breaking down rocks into small bits.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What are mechanical weathering and chemical weathering?</p>
    <p>Mechanical weathering is physical disintegration of a rock into smaller fragments, each with the same properties as the original. Chemical weathering is the process by which the internal structure of a mineral is altered by the addition or removal of elements.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What natural processes contribute to soil formation?</p>
    <p>Parent materials.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What methods help to control soil loss?</p>
    <p>Vegetation & Geotextiles, to name a couple.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How do erosional agents, such as water, wind, ice, and gravity, shape the landscape?</p>
    <p>The erosional agents break up rocks, sediments, and soil from the land's surface.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What are examples of different landforms created by erosion? (please include a picture/image)</p>
    <p>Arches (pictured below), platforms, and sea stacks.</p>

    <h2 id="qa">Q&A</h2>
    <br>
    <p>What is the role of weathering in recycling Earth materials?</p>
    <p>Breaking down rocks into small bits.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What are mechanical weathering and chemical weathering?</p>
    <p>Mechanical weathering is physical disintegration of a rock into smaller fragments, each with the same properties as the original. Chemical weathering is the process by which the internal structure of a mineral is altered by the addition or removal of elements.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What natural processes contribute to soil formation?</p>
    <p>Parent materials.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What methods help to control soil loss?</p>
    <p>Vegetation & Geotextiles, to name a couple.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How do erosional agents, such as water, wind, ice, and gravity, shape the landscape?</p>
    <p>The erosional agents break up rocks, sediments, and soil from the land's surface.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What are examples of different landforms created by erosion?</p>
    <p>Arches (pictured below), platforms, and sea stacks.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What are examples of different landforms created by deposition?</p>
    <p>Beaches, spits, and bars.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Why is groundwater an important natural resource?</p>
    <p>Groundwater is about 33% of of the water that water works supply to homes and businesses.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Where is groundwater stored, and how can it be obtained?</p>
    <p>It is stored in moderately to highly permeable rocks called aquifiers. It can be obtained by digging or drilling a well.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Do we have enough groundwater to meet the demand of human beings?</p>
    <p>No.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What are geologic epochs, periods, and eras?</p>
    <p>An epoch is no longer than an age, but shorter than a period. A period is a point in time. An era divides eons into smaller periods of time.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What are the characteristics of the main geologic eras?</p>
    <p>Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Which geologic laws are used to determine relative age?</p>
    <p>Principles of Superposition & Original Horizontality, to name a couple.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What methods are used to determine absolute age?</p>
    <p>Radiometric methods.</p>

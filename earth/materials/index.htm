    <h2 id="qa">Q&A</h2>
    <br>
    <p>What are common properties of minerals?</p>
    <p>Color, streak, hardness, luster, diaphaneity, fracture, magnetism, and many more.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How can physical properties be used to identify an unknown mineral?</p>
    <p>You can identify a mineral by it's appearance, as well as other properties.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How do minerals form?</p>
    <p>Minerals can form on the surface, as well as underground. On the surface, they form through evaporation of solutions, including dissolved minerals. Beneath the surface, they form when dissolved elements and compounds leave a hot water solution, or when materials melted in magma, as well as lava, cools and hardens.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What are common characteristics of rocks?</p>
    <p>They can be bumpy, smooth, colorful, hard, soft, and more.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Under what conditions do igneous rocks form?</p>
    <p>Igneous rocks form when magma, or lava, cools and solidifies. They can form with or without crystals.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How are igneous rocks classified?</p>
    <p>Igneous rocks can be classified by their chemical or mineral composition.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How do sedimentary rocks form?</p>
    <p>Sedimentary rocks are formed when sediment is deposited from air, ice, wind, gravity, or when water flows, carrying the particles in suspension.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Where do sedimentary rocks form?</p>
    <p>Sedimentary rocks form on the floors of oceans, seas, or any other body of water.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Can sedimentary rocks be used to interpret Earth’s history?</p>
    <p>Yes, because some sedimentary rocks can hold fossils.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How are sedimentary rocks classified?</p>
    <p>Geologists divide sedimentary rocks into two major categories, what they are made of, and how they form.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What are the physical conditions that cause metamorphism?</p>
    <p>The three physical conditions that cause metamorphism are prograde and retrograde.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Where does metamorphism occur?</p>
    <p>Metamorphism usually occurs anywhere where the temperature is 200 degrees Celsius or higher.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How are metamorphic rocks classified?</p>
    <p>Metamorphic rocks are classified based on their texture.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What is the rock cycle?</p>
    <p>The rock cycle is a cycle of processes undergone in the earth's crust, involving igneous intrusion, uplift, erosion, transportation, and more.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Mineral</p>
    <p>A solid inorganic substance of natural occurance.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Streak</p>
    <p>A test used to determine the color of a mineral's powder.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Cleavage</p>
    <p>Manner in which a mineral breaks along planes of weakness, creating sets of smooth parallel sides; determined by the arrangement of atoms in the mineral’s structure.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Fracture</p>
    <p>Any kind of separation or break in rock formation.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Hardness</p>
    <p>Something measured by the resistance which a smooth surface offers to abrasion.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Magma</p>
    <p>A mixture of molten rock, volatiles, and solids, and found beneath the Earth's surface.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Rock</p>
    <p>A natural substance formed by magma, sediment, or metamorphism.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Intrusive Igneous Rock</p>
    <p>Forms when magma slowly cools beneath Earth's surface, and usually forms with well shaped crystals.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Extrusive Igneous Rock</p>
    <p>Forms when magma reaches Earth's surface and cools quickly.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Clast</p>
    <p>A constituent fragment found in clastic rocks.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Pore Space</p>
    <p>Empty space between clasts, and contain water, oil, and natural gas.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Compaction</p>
    <p>A process in which clasts stick together due to the weight of overlying material.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Cementation</p>
    <p>The process of minerals precipitating out of solution, into the spaces between clasts.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Foliated</p>
    <p>Texture of some metamorphic rocks in which crystals are arranged in layers and bands as a result of high pressure conditions.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Rock Cycle</p>
    <p>The continual changing of rocks into different types through different processes.</p>

    <h2 id="qa">Q&A</h2>
    <br>
    <p>What evidence led to the development of the continental drift hypothesis?</p>
    <p>If the continents in the Atlantic Ocean were puzzle pieces, they would fit together in a certain way.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What is the plate tectonics theory?</p>
    <p>The plate tectonics theory is a theory that the lithosphere is divided into approximately two dozen "plates" that move around relative to each other, similar to ice slabs on a frozen lake.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How is mantle convection used to support the plate tectonics theory?</p>
    <p>Some geologists believe that the main factor of of the motion of plate tectonics is the mantle's convection currents.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How do geologists study Earth’s interior?</p>
    <p>They record the seismic waves, and study how they travel through Earth.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How does the composition and structure of each of Earth’s layers differ?</p>
    <p>The crust is the ground that we stand on, and the lithosphere is believed to contain the tectonic plates, to name a few.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Mid-ocean ridge</p>
    <p>Underwater mountain ranges, formed by plate tectonics.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Rift valley</p>
    <p>A linear-shaped lowland between highlands or mountain ranges created by action of geologic rift or fault.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Convergent plate boundary</p>
    <p>A tectonic boundry where two plates move toward each other.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Subduction</p>
    <p>The sideways and downward movement of the edge of a plate of the Earth's crust into the mantle beneath other plates.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Divergent plate boundary</p>
    <p>A linear feature existing between two tectonic plates moving away from each other.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Transform plate boundary</p>
    <p>A plate boundry where motion is predominantly horizontal.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Lithosphere</p>
    <p>The rigid outer layer of the earth, consisting of the crust, as well as the upper mantle.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Asthenosphere</p>
    <p>The layer below the lithosphere, consisting of melting, plastic-like material.</p>

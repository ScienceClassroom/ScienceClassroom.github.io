    <h2 id="qa">Q&A</h2>
    <br>
    <p>What evidence led to the development of the continental drift hypothesis?</p>
    <p>If the continents in the Atlantic Ocean were puzzle pieces, they would fit together in a certain way.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What is the plate tectonics theory?</p>
    <p>The plate tectonics theory is a theory that the lithosphere is divided into approximately two dozen "plates" that move around relative to each other, similar to ice slabs on a frozen lake.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How is mantle convection used to support the plate tectonics theory?</p>
    <p>Some geologists believe that the main factor of of the motion of plate tectonics is the mantle's convection currents.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How do geologists study Earth’s interior?</p>
    <p>They record the seismic waves, and study how they travel through Earth.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How does the composition and structure of each of Earth’s layers differ?</p>
    <p>The crust is the ground that we stand on, and the lithosphere is believed to contain the tectonic plates, to name a few.</p>

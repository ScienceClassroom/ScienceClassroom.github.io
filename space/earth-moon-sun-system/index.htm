    <br>
    <h2 id="qa">Q&A</h2>
    <br>
    <p>What do we know about Earth's physical properties?</p>
    <p>The Earth consists of rock, dirt, water, and many more.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Why does Earth have a magnetic field?</p>
    <p>It is believed that the Earth's magnetic field is generated by the it's core.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How does Earth compare to Venus and Mars?</p>
    <p>All three of them have a solid surface, to name one.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How are Earth’s movements used to measure time?</p>
    <p>We measure time by the movement of the sun, moon, and stars.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What is the difference between revolution and rotation?</p>
    <p>When an object turns around an interal axis, it is a rotation. When the object circles an external axis, it is a revolution.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Why do seasons change throughout the course of the year?</p>
    <p>Because the side of the Earth facing the sun changes.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How do the relative positions of the Sun, the Moon, and Earth cause the Moon’s phases?</p>
    <p>The sun's reflections cause the moon's phases.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How are tides on Earth affected by the Moon and the Sun?</p>
    <p>The moon's gravitational pull is strong enough to make waves in the ocean.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What is the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse?</p>
    <p>A lunar eclipse is when the moon's light is blocked by Earth's shadow. A solar eclipse is when the moon passes between Earth and the Sun.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What do surface features of the Moon reveal about its history?</p>
    <p>It used to have volcanoes.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Sphere</p>
    <p>A round solid figure, or its surface, with every point on its surface equidistant from its center.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Ellipse</p>
    <p>A elongated, closed curve with two foci; shape of Earth's orbit around the sun.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Time Zone</p>
    <p>Any one of 24 longitudinal strips on Earth about 15 degrees wide on Earth's surface in which local time is the same.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Rotation</p>
    <p>Spinning of Earth on it's axis; used to measure time in days.</p>
    <img src="https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/images/rotation-2d.svg" />
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Revolution</p>
    <p>Motion of Earth around the sun, used to measure time in years.</p>
    <img src="https://www.scienceabc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Earth-revolution.jpg" />
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Ecliptic</p>
    <p>Path of Earth's orbit around the sun.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Solstice</p>
    <p>Occurs twice a year (June and December) when Earth's rotational axis is the most toward, or away, from the sun.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Equinox</p>
    <p>Occurs twice a year (March and September) when Earth's rotational axis is perpendicular to a line connecting Earth's center to the center of the sun.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Tide</p>
    <p>The periodic rise and fall of sea levcel caused by the gravitational attraction among Earth, the moon, and the sun.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Moon Phase</p>
    <p>Changing appearance of the moon as viewed from Earth, depending on the relative positions of the sun, the moon, and Earth.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Solar Eclipse</p>
    <p>Occurs during the new moon, when Earth enters the moon's umbra and casts a shadow on the Earth's surface.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Lunar Eclipse</p>
    <p>Occurs during the full moon, when the moon enters Earth's umbra and Earth casts a curved shadow on the moon's surface.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Maria</p>
    <p>Relatively flat, dark-colored regions on the moon's surface.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Regolith</p>
    <p>Layer of debris on the moon's surface formed by the accumulation of meteoric material.</p>

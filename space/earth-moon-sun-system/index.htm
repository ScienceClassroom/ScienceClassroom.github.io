    <h2 id="qa">Q&A</h2>
    <br>
    <p>What do we know about Earth's physical properties?</p>
    <p>The Earth consists of rock, dirt, water, and many more.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Why does Earth have a magnetic field?</p>
    <p>It is believed that the Earth's magnetic field is generated by the it's core.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How does Earth compare to Venus and Mars?</p>
    <p>All three of them have a solid surface, to name one.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How are Earth’s movements used to measure time?</p>
    <p>We measure time by the movement of the sun, moon, and stars.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What is the difference between revolution and rotation?</p>
    <p>When an object turns around an interal axis, it is a rotation. When the object circles an external axis, it is a revolution.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Why do seasons change throughout the course of the year?</p>
    <p>Because the side of the Earth facing the sun changes.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How do the relative positions of the Sun, the Moon, and Earth cause the Moon’s phases?</p>
    <p>The sun's reflections cause the moon's phases.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How are tides on Earth affected by the Moon and the Sun?</p>
    <p>The moon's gravitational pull is strong enough to make waves in the ocean.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What is the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse?</p>
    <p>A lunar eclipse is when the moon's light is blocked by Earth's shadow. A solar eclipse is when the moon passes between Earth and the Sun.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What do surface features of the Moon reveal about its history?</p>
    <p>It used to have volcanoes.</p>

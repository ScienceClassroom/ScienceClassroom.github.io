    <h2 id="qa">Q&A</h2>
    <br>
    <p>How do geocentric and heliocentric models of the solar system differ?</p>
    <p>The geocentric model is Earth-centered, while the heliocentric model is Sun-centered.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What is each planet’s position in the solar system?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Mercury</li>
      <li>Venus</li>
      <li>Earth</li>
      <li>Mars</li>
      <li>Jupiter</li>
      <li>Saturn</li>
      <li>Uranus</li>
      <li>Neptune</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How are planets classified?</p>
    <p>Planets similar to Earth in size, structure, and composition are called terrestrial planets. The gas giants are called Jovian planets.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What are the important surface features of the inner planets?</p>
    <p>Most planets close to the sun are made of rock.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How does Earth’s atmosphere compare to the atmospheres of Mercury, Venus, and Mars?</p>
    <p>Mercury has no atmosphere, Venus' atmosphere has 92 times the surface pressure of Earth's at sea level, and Mars' atmosphere is much thinner than Earth's atmosphere.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>How do the outer planets compare and contrast?</p>
    <p>The outer planets are larger and mostly made of gas.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What are some important characteristics of each outer planet?</p>
    <p>They all have gas, and are all larger in size.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What are the successes of NASA missions Galileo and Cassini to explore the outer solar system?</p>
    <p>The Galileo probe studied the composition, structure, and motion, of Jupiter's atmosphere, and many features of it's moons, including the active volcano. The Cassini probe has collected data on Saturn about it's rings and many moons. Saturn is now known to have at least 60 moons.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What does life in extreme environments on Earth suggest about the possibility of life elsewhere in the solar system?</p>
    <p>That life is possible elsewhere in the solar system.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What conditions do scientists look for when evaluating the possibility of life on a planet or moon?</p>
    <p>Conditions similar to Earth, like exotic environments.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Where is NASA searching for life beyond planet Earth?</p>
    <p>Elsewhere in the solar system, mostly Mars.</p>
